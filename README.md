## üîç Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Inspection
- Loaded and displayed first few rows using `pandas`
- Verified data shape, column names, and data types
- Checked for null values and duplicate entries

### 2. Data Cleaning & Type Conversion
- Converted `Store ID` from float to integer
- Ensured consistency in data types for accurate analysis

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- Calculated revenue by store and ranked top 10
- Counted daily customer visits by store ID
- Ranked stores by `Store_Area`
- Used bar charts and pie charts for easy interpretation

### 4. Bivariate & Correlation Analysis
- Visualized relationship between `Items_Available` and `Daily_Customer_Count` using scatter plots
- Explored correlation between store attributes and sales behavior
- Used regression plots for price vs furnished apartments

---

## üí° Key Insights

- **Store Performance:** Top 10 stores by revenue exhibit significantly higher customer counts.
- **Customer Behavior:** Stores with more items available tend to attract more customers.
- **Store Area Impact:** Larger stores tend to contribute more to total revenue.
- **Inventory vs Demand:** There's a positive correlation between item availability and daily footfall.
